edn-scala
=========

A Scala wrapper around edn-java; Provides some Scala sugar for accessing [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) files.

## Aims of the project
  - Reduce verbosity of accessing keys and values
  - Return Scala collection classes to allow idiomatic operations on file contents
  - Employ Scala ```Option```s rather than returning ```null``` values


## Credits
  - Obviously, the [edn-java](https://github.com/bpsm/edn-java) is the thing doing the heavy-lifting here.

This library is currently a work-in-progess, as is (apparently) *edn-java* so don't expect much here until a public artifact location is listed here.
